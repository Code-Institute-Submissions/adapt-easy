# **Adapt Easy**

View live project here 

Adapt Easy is a full stack application targeting small business owners and their customer bases. It allows both small business owners/managers and their customers to see how their business has adapted to suit new COVID requirements. It will allow businesses to effectively communicate these adaptations to their customers in a clear way to make sure everyone stays safe during the pandemic.

Small business owners will be able to give a short description of their business, the COVID adaptation requirements and the time until this adaption will be implemented. Customers will also be able to see if wearing a mask is required to visit the business. Business owners will be able to create listings, update them and delete them as COVID requirements and restrictions change. 

**For viewing and assessing pruposes, an admin account has been made. Username: Admin, Password: Admin**

## Design

Overall, the design of this site is meant to be simple, easy to see and understand, and accessible for all users. 

This application is aimed at both the concious consumer and cautious business owner. During COVID-19 is of utmost importance that we make use of the local services to help 'keep the lights on' while still focussing on the safety of the staff. 

The overall design idea behind this was to keep the application as accessible for all users.

Adapt Easy is easily navigated. Users can easily log in and out of the session and will see different parts of the app when session use is logged in. 

Adapt Easy pages primarily consist of three sections each: 

1. Navbar
A responsive navbar with links to Home, Listings, Profile, Login, Register, Logout, and New Listing pages. 

2. Main Action Section
This is where the information for the user lies, be it the information of the site itself, how the user actions the CRUD functionality, how the user logs in or registers an account.

3. Footer
A responsive footer, with Contact Details, links for the login, register, as well as the Home Page.

When the user is logged in they will be able to direct themselves to the Home, Listings, Profile, New Listings and Logout pages
When there is no current session user logged in, they will be able to access the Home, Listings, Login and Register Page



### Colour Scheme

I made use of primarily the following four colours throughout Adapt Easy

![colour scheme](static/images/adapt-easy-colours.JPG)

### Typography

The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the site with Sans-serif as the fallback in case the font is not being imported into the site correctly. 

The Rubik font is used for the main headings on each of the pages, as well as the Brand Logo in the nav bar. This font is popular in current stylish sites and is easily read. Sans-serif is the fallback as well. 

### Imagery

Imagery is important to creat an eye-catching site. There are images primarily on the Home, Login and Register pages. There is an image in the New Listings page of an empty city to signify what busy cities now look like due to restrictions.
