# **Adapt Easy**

View live project here 

Adapt Easy is a full stack application targeting small business owners and their customer bases. It allows both small business owners/managers and their customers to see how their business has adapted to suit new COVID requirements. It will allow businesses to effectively communicate these adaptations to their customers in a clear way to make sure everyone stays safe during the pandemic.

Small business owners will be able to give a short description of their business, the COVID adaptation requirements and the time until this adaption will be implemented. Customers will also be able to see if wearing a mask is required to visit the business. Business owners will be able to create listings, update them and delete them as COVID requirements and restrictions change.
