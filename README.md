# **Adapt Easy**

![Mockup](static/images/mockup.JPG)

View live project here 

Adapt Easy is a full stack application targeting small business owners and their customer bases. It allows both small business owners/managers and their customers to see how their business has adapted to suit new COVID requirements. It will allow businesses to effectively communicate these adaptations to their customers in a clear way to make sure everyone stays safe during the pandemic.

Small business owners will be able to give a short description of their business, the COVID adaptation requirements and the time until this adaption will be implemented. Customers will also be able to see if wearing a mask is required to visit the business. Business owners will be able to create listings, update them and delete them as COVID requirements and restrictions change. 

**For viewing and assessing pruposes, an admin account has been made. Username: Admin, Password: Admin**

## Design

Overall, the design of this site is meant to be simple, easy to see and understand, and accessible for all users. 

This application is aimed at both the concious consumer and cautious business owner. During COVID-19 is of utmost importance that we make use of the local services to help 'keep the lights on' while still focussing on the safety of the staff. 

The overall design idea behind this was to keep the application as accessible for all users.

Adapt Easy is easily navigated. Users can easily log in and out of the session and will see different parts of the app when session use is logged in. 

Adapt Easy pages primarily consist of three sections each: 

1. Navbar
A responsive navbar with links to Home, Listings, Profile, Login, Register, Logout, and New Listing pages. 

2. Main Action Section
This is where the information for the user lies, be it the information of the site itself, how the user actions the CRUD functionality, how the user logs in or registers an account.

3. Footer
A responsive footer, with Contact Details, links for the login, register, as well as the Home Page.

When the user is logged in they will be able to direct themselves to the Home, Listings, Profile, New Listings and Logout pages
When there is no current session user logged in, they will be able to access the Home, Listings, Login and Register Page



### Colour Scheme

I made use of primarily the following four colours throughout Adapt Easy

![colour scheme](static/images/adapt-easy-colours.JPG)

### Typography

The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the site with Sans-serif as the fallback in case the font is not being imported into the site correctly. 

The Rubik font is used for the main headings on each of the pages, as well as the Brand Logo in the nav bar. This font is popular in current stylish sites and is easily read. Sans-serif is the fallback as well. 

### Imagery

Imagery is important to creat an eye-catching site. There are images primarily on the Home, Login and Register pages. There is an image in the New Listings page of an empty city to signify what busy cities now look like due to restrictions.

- Adapt Easy Description
  - This is a short 3 paragraphs used to introfuce the user to the app and how the app may benefit them as a concious consumer or a small business owner. 
 
- Extra Navigation Buttons
  - These two buttons are a quick way for a consumer to navigate to the listings page or a small business owner to the register page to get started. These buttons allow for easy navigation for new users

#### Register and Login Pages

- These pages both follow the same structure:
  - Main Image to the left of the page.
  - Form with username and password input as well a submit button.
  - A discrete link to either the Login/Register page should the user see they may still need to set up their account or can simply login
 
 #### Listings Page

  - An image at the bottom of the page

#### Profile Page 

- Similar to the Listings page, the profile page allows the current session user to see all of their listings. Each of the card panels also contain an Edit and Delete buttons to allow the user to edit their own listings.

## Features Left To Implement 

There are several features planned for future implementation of this project 

- Pagination
  - This could allow the user to click through the listings instead of scrolling down the page

- Maps API
  - This feature could allow the user to see exactly where the listed businesses are located in order to track those in their local area 
  - This feature would also allow users to see more bsuiness details as listed on Google

- Sharing listings with other
  - This feature will allow the user to easily share their business adaption with other to help spread the word, not COVID!

# Technologies Used

- Gitpod - Used as the IDE for this application.
- Github used for the remote storage of the code online.

## Font-End Technologies
- HTML - Used to create the structure of the application.
- CSS - Used as the base for styling.
- Javascript - Used to create interactivity within the project
- JQuery - Used for some of the main javascript functionality.
- Materialize - Used  as the design framework.

- The data stored in the database are the following:
  - Object ID
  - String
 
### There are Three Core Collections within the Database 

#### Users

| Title         | Key in db     | for validation type  | Data Type |

# Testing 

## Code Testing 

### Validator Testing 

[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)

- HTML 
  - No errors in HTML were notes
  
- CSS
  - No errors in CSS were noted

 [JSHINT](https://jshint.com/)

- When run through the [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/) these metrics were returned:
  - There are 7 functions in this file.
  -  Function with the largest signature take 0 arguments, while the median is 0.
  -  Largest function has 7 statements in it, while the median is 3.
  -  The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 3 while the median is 2..

- Two warnings
  - 28	'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
  -  29	'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

- One undefinied variables were noted which are due to the use of JQuery:
  - $

[Python PEP8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)

- The autopep8 extension was installed in the workspace.

- To install this enter this in the terminal:
  - `pip3 install --upgrade autopep8`

- Then, you can format the code into PEP8 formatting by entering this command into the terminal:
  - `autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive app.py`
  
Due to my overall experience with Python, I elected not to follow the PEP8 formatting during the creation of the application, however decided to format the code into PEP8 after the app.py was written.

Now after this application is complete, I am more aware of the requiremetns to follow t follow the PEP8 formatting and will be following this in the future.

When the ``app.py`` code is pasted into PEP8 checker, no errors appeard 
- ([Results](http://pep8online.com/checkresult))

### Known Issues 
- Resolved 
  - The colour scheme did not suit the images that I originally used therefore had to get a new colour scheme
  - The profile page was showing all listing, not restricting to just the session user
- Unresolved
  - The two buttons on the home page may not look the best on smaller screens, due to a restriction in time I did not get to solve this issue. 
  - The listings can look squashed on smaller screens
  - The forms validation still make use of the standard materialize colours, this does clash with the new colour scheme
